# TicTacThrones
A reimagined version of the legendary tic-tac-toe game.

You can play the game at: https://tictac-thrones.web.app/

In this game the board is divided into simultaneous games of the classic children's game, tic-tac-toe. On your turn you
can claim a square that is in the area determined by your opponents last move. If you win a small game of tic-tac-toe
you can claim the region of the board it is on. If you have three of these regions in a line you win.
